# Pokemon-go API Demo in Ruby

I'd rather be programming, but I still wanna catch'em all.
Seeing if it's possible to automate the entire game.

__NOTE:__ This project is temporarily halted while I work on porting [gpsoauth](https://github.com/simon-weber/gpsoauth) to Ruby, which is necessary to continue.

#### Installation

    Bundle install

#### Usage

    ruby ./lib/pokemon-go.rb


Based on this Python demo: [https://github.com/tejado/pgoapi](https://github.com/tejado/pgoapi)
